Webpack budles our source code into a single file.

index.js imports React, ReactDOM, and the Menu.js file. This is what we want to run in our browswer first
Where ever webpack finds an import statment, finds the assosiated module and includes it in the bundle
Menus.js -> Recipe.js -> Instructions.js and IngredientList.js -> Ingredient.js. 
Webpack will follow this import tree and include all of the necessary modules in our bundle. 
As webpack build the bundle, tell it to transform JSX into React elements
