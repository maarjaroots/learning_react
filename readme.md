# Working with Rect in the browser

## Why am I doing this?

There are minimus requirements for working with React in the browser. I need to use two libraries: React and ReactDOM. React is the libary for creating views and ReactDOM for rendering the UI in the browser. I'm exploring how to use them from scrach. 

## What can you do with it?

You can clone this file and test different parts of it. You can uncomment a line which starts with **ReactDOM.render**. (remeber that you can only use one ReactDOM.render). 
To see in in the browser - open the html document in the live browser.
